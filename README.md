## What is Cody?

Cody is an open-source AI coding assistant that helps you understand, write, and fix code faster. It uses advanced search to pull context from both local and remote codebases so that you can use context about APIs, symbols, and usage patterns from across your codebase at any scale, all from within your IDE.

## What can Cody do?

- **Chat:** Ask Cody questions about your codebase. Cody will use semantic search to retrieve files from your codebase and use context from those files to answer your questions. You can @-mention files to target specific context.
- **Autocomplete:** Cody makes single-line and multi-line suggestions as you type, speeding up your coding and shortcutting the need for you to hunt down function and variable names as you type.
- **Inline Edit:** Ask Cody to fix or refactor code from anywhere in a file.
- **Prompts:** Cody has quick, customizable prompts for common actions. Simply highlight a code snippet and run a prompt, like "Document code," "Explain code," or "Generate Unit Tests."
- **Swappable LLMs:** Support for Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4o, Mixtral, Gemini 1.5, and more with your own API keys.
