"# Hello World in Java

I'll create a simple "Hello World" function in Java. In Java, functions exist inside classes, so I'll create a class with a \`helloWorld()\` method and include a \`main()\` method to execute it.

\`\`\`java:HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {

    // Hello World function
    public static void printHelloWorld() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    // Main method to execute the program
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printHelloWorld();
    }
}
\`\`\`

To compile and run this program, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

\`\`\`bash
javac HelloWorld.java
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
java HelloWorld
\`\`\`

This will output \`Hello, World!\` to the console. The program defines a simple \`printHelloWorld()\` function that prints the message, and it's called from the main method which serves as the entry point for Java applications."
