Release Notes Template Instructions
----
Before creating a new release:
1. Rename the existing 'current.md' file to 'v[major].[minor].md', e.g., v7.79.md
2. Create a new 'current.md' by copying the contents of 'template.md'
----
Contributing to Release Notes:
1. When submitting a pull request, add a summary of your changes under your GitHub username section
2. If your GitHub username is not listed, please:
   - Add it in alphabetical order to both template.md and current.md files
   - Follow the existing comment format
--
Guidelines:
A good release note entry should be clear, concise, and user-focused. 
It should start with a brief summary of the change or feature in plain language that users can easily understand.
Include any important technical details, potential impact on existing workflows, 
and steps required for users to take advantage of the change. 
If applicable, add links to relevant documentation or issue numbers. 
Keep the tone professional and avoid technical jargon unless necessary. 
Format your entry consistently with other entries.
Remember that release notes serve as a communication bridge between developers and users, 
so prioritize information that matters to your audience.
